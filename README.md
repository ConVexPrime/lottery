  Currently working on:
  <ul>
    <li>2/3/18: Flask app -  No idea what I'm doing or if what I'm doing makes sense to be doing.  However, it is fun to be trying to figure something out instead of just following tutorials.</li>
    <li>2/4/18: Javascript - The flask app is out.  It's not going to work like I thought it would.  I'm rewriting the whole thing in javascript, and moving forward from there.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
